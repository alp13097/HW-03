# Unit 03 JavaScript: Password Generator

In this assignment, I created the code necessary for the random password website to function properly given certian criteria using JavaScript.  I am confident that the site works properly no matter what combination you may choose by using if/else statements and different functions.


# Reflection

This assignment was genuinly challenging at first until I figured out how to go about it.  I had to ask for help at a couple points in the beginning but eventually figured out a plan. I know theres a shorthand way of writing if/else statements but I couldnt remember how and I couldnt find it online anywhere so my code turned out a lot longer than what I would have liked but im happy with its full functionality.
